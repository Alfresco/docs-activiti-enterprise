Title: OOTB connectors
---

# OOTB connectors
Out of the box (OOTB) connectors are a set of pre-defined connectors that have been developed and are available to insert into service tasks within the Modeling Application. The available connectors are: 

* Email
* REST
* Lambda
* Camel
* Salesforce
* Slack
* Twilio

## Modeling OOTB connectors
OOTB connectors can be selected directly from the palette rather than by selecting a standard service task, though the input and output parameters need to be configured to process variables as with a standard service task. Details of the input and output parameters for each OOTB connector are described in their respective documentation. 

## Deploying OOTB connectors
The location of the images for OOTB connectors are predefined within the Administrator Application. When [deploying an application](../../../administrator/admin-deployment.md#deploying-a-project) select the relevant connector(s) from the dropdown menu.
