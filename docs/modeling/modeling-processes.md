# Processes
Processes is the area where you create your business processes using BPMN elements. Components such as forms, connectors and decision tables that you design elsewhere in the Modeling Application are linked to their relevant process definitions here. 

BPMN elements can be created or updated using the drag-and-drop GUI or by using the inbuilt XML editor. It is also possible to upload an existing process definition using the upload function.  

Processes are primarly composed of BPMN elements. Descriptions of each [available element](../bpmn/README.md) are available.
