# Forms
Forms are created in a similar fashion to processes, by using a drag-and-drop GUI. There is also a JSON editor for forms that updates as new elements are added and removed to the GUI. 

Forms can be split into multiple tabs and each tab individually named to logically split up form fields. 

Each row of form fields added allows that row to be split into a number of columns; 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. Column count between rows does not have to match on the same tab or form.

Forms are most commonly associated with user tasks. This is where human intervention is required within a process and this intervention is handled by filling in a form, surfaced in a userâ€™s task list. 

The form fields currently available for modeling can be viewed in the form fields section.
