Title: Scripts

# Scripts 
Scripts are used to execute a specific script outside of a process. Process variables can be passed to the script and the results of a script can be sent back to a process instance as process variables.

The languages a script can be written in are the following:

* C
* Java
* Javascript
* Python
* R
* Ruby

## Naming  
Script names must be in lowercase and between 1 and 26 characters in length. Alphanumeric characters and hyphens are allowed, however the name must begin with a letter and end alphanumerically. 

The following are examples of valid script names: 

```
ruby-script
java4
c-script-beta
```

## Using scripts
Scripts can be added to a process definition by creating a [script task](../modeling/processes/bpmn/script.md) and selecting the `name` of a script created in the project from the dropdown.
