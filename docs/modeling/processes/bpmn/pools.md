Title: Pools and lanes

# Pools and lanes 
Pools are used to model different participants in a process definition such as different organizations or different business personas such as a customer and a manufacturer. Lanes are used to graphically represent different roles within an organization such as by different departments.

## Pools
Pools allow multiple processes to be modeled in a single process definition. The scope of [process variables](../../processes/variables.md) are restricted to each process itself. Only [message events](../bpmn/message.md) can be used to communicate between the two processes. 

An example of using two pools would be for a customer to fill out an order in one process that sends a message on order completion triggering a second process for a warehouse team to action. The two processes would have different process instance IDs at runtime but would both be using the same process definition. 

### Properties
When a pool is added to a process definition a `collaboration` is created in the XML with each pool being referenced by a `participant` each of which reference the process ID of the process they contain using the `processRef` attribute. 

```xml
<bpmn2:collaboration id="Collaboration_0kgbwi1">
	<bpmn2:participant id="Participant_1i6u1my" processRef="Process_1d9yxsm" />
	<bpmn2:participant id="Participant_10umhbc" processRef="Process_1piiyp4" />
</bpmn2:collaboration>
```

Each element of a pool contains the same set of basic properties: 

| Property | Description | Example | Required | 
| -------- | ----------- | ------- | -------- | 
| `id` | The unique identifier for the element. This is system generated and cannot be altered | Participant_1i6u1my | Yes |
| `name` | The name of the element. This will display on the element in the process diagram | Flavor order | No |
| `documentation` | A free text description of what the element is | A pool modeling the customer journey.  | No | 

## Lanes
Lanes are used to display the different personas affecting a process to the modeler. Lanes have no impact on a process at runtime. Lanes can also be nested for example to show different teams within a department. 

When lanes are added to a pool, a `laneSet` is added within the process itself which in turn contains multiple `lane` elements. The `flowNodeRef` is used to reference which BPMN elements are contained in each lane using their `id`. 

```xml
<bpmn2:process id="Process_1d9yxsm">
	<bpmn2:laneSet id="LaneSet_1b8nhx7">
		<bpmn2:lane id="Lane_104t61m" name="HR Department">
			<bpmn2:flowNodeRef>Event_0b61hqt</bpmn2:flowNodeRef>
			<bpmn2:flowNodeRef>Gateway_1dmrhcn</bpmn2:flowNodeRef>
		</bpmn2:lane>
		<bpmn2:lane id="Lane_1i3x8rz" name="Finance Department">
			<bpmn2:flowNodeRef>Task_16ju082</bpmn2:flowNodeRef>
			<bpmn2:flowNodeRef>Event_00acemq</bpmn2:flowNodeRef>
		</bpmn2:lane>
</bpmn2:laneSet>
```

### Properties
The basic properties for a lane are: 

| Property | Description | Example | Required | 
| -------- | ----------- | ------- | -------- | 
| `id` | The unique identifier for the lane. This is system generated and cannot be altered | UserTask_0gpdh83 | Yes |
| `name` | The name of the lane. This will display in the lane on the process diagram | HR Department | No |
| `documentation` | A free text description of what the lane does | The HR Department receive the form and take appropriate action.  | No |
