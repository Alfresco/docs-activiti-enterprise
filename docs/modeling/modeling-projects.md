# Projects
A project is the top level component of your business application. This is what your processes and forms are created, linked and stored in. Once a project has been deployed (i.e. at runtime), it is referred to as an application. 

## Releasing
A project cannot be deployed using the Administrator Application until it has been released using the Modeling Application.
