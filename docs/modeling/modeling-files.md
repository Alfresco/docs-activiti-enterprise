# Files
Files are created and stored for each element of a project.

* .bpmn20.xml
* -extensions.json
* connector.json
* appname.json

## File structure
A folder is created for each project in the Modeling Application that contains a set structure for each element type. When you download a project, the extracted zip file will be in the same structure as the project is stored in Alfresco Content Services.  

```
/holiday/
	/processes/
		approve-extensions.json
		approve.bpmn.xml
		request-extensions.json
		request.bpmn20.xml
	/connectors/
		emailconnector.json
	holiday.json
```
