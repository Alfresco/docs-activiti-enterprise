# Deploying Alfresco Activiti Enterprise
There are four options for deploying Activiti Enterprise. All deployment options involve containerized deployment using [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) and either [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) or [Helm](https://helm.sh):

* Using Terraform: 
	* [Deployment with Rancher on Amazon EKS](../deployment/terraform.md#deployment-with-rancher-on-amazon-eks)
	* [Deployment on Amazon EKS](../deployment/terraform.md#deployment-on-amazon-eks)
	* [Deployment into an existing Kubernetes cluster](../deployment/terraform.md#deployment-into-an-existing-kubernetes-cluster)
	
* [Using Helm charts](../deployment/helm/README.md)
