# Alfresco Process Workspace

The Alfresco Process Workspace is used to view and manage tasks and processes.

There is a set of preset filters applied to process and task lists that can be customized or saved into new lists. 

The URL for Process Workspace will be in the format: `{my-domain}/alfresco-process-app`

Once you have first signed into the Process Workspace, the list of applications available for you to monitor is presented. After selecting an application to work within, you are able to Create a new process or task for it. 

## Tasks
Tasks displays information about all tasks within the selected application. The default views are for tasks assigned to the currently signed in user under My Tasks and all completed tasks under Completed Tasks. 

Each view has a customizable filter associated with it, that can be used to change the task status on display, assigned user displayed and options on the sort field and order. Editing a filter gives the option to save it in the current view or as a new view. 

Selecting a specific task opens up an information panel which displays basic properties about the task. 

The possible statuses for tasks are:

|Status|Description|
|------|-----------|
|CREATED|Task has not yet been assigned.|
|ASSIGNED|Task is assigned but has not been completed.|
|SUSPENDED|Task has been suspended and needs to be reactivated to continue.|
|CANCELLED|Task has been cancelled and cannot be completed.|
|COMPLETED|Task has been completed.|

## Processes
Processes displays information about all process instances within the selected application. The default views are for currently running process instances under Running Processes and all completed process instances under Completed Processes. There is a further view that shows both completed and running process instances called All Processes. 

Each view has a customizable filter associated with it, that can be used to change the process status on display and change the sort field and order. Editing a filter gives the option to save it in the current view or as a new view. 

Selecting a specific process instance opens up an information panel which displays basic properties about the process instance. 

The possible statuses of a process instance are as follows:

|Status|Description|
|------|-----------|
|RUNNING|Process instance is currently running.|
|COMPLETED|Process instance is complete.|
|SUSPENDED|Process instance is currently suspended and cannot continue until it is reactivated.|
|CANCELLED|Process instance has been cancelled and cannot be completed.|
