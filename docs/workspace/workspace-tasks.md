# Workspace tasks
The tasks section displays information about all tasks within the selected application. The default views are for tasks assigned to the currently signed in user under My Tasks and all completed tasks under Completed Tasks. 

Each view has a customizable filter associated with it, that can be used to change the task status on display, assigned user displayed and options on the sort field and order. Editing a filter gives the option to save it in the current view or as a new view. 

Selecting a specific task opens up an information panel which displays basic properties about the task. 

The possible statuses for tasks are:

| Status | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| CREATED | The task has not yet been assigned |
| ASSIGNED | The task is assigned but has not been completed |
| SUSPENDED | The task has been suspended and needs to be reactivated to continue |
| COMPLETED | The task has been completed |
| CANCELLED | The task has been cancelled and cannot be completed |
