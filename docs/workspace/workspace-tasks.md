# Workspace tasks
The tasks section displays information about all tasks within the selected application. The default views are for tasks assigned to the currently signed in user under My Tasks and all completed tasks under Completed Tasks. 

Each view has a customizable filter associated with it, that can be used to change the task status on display, assigned user displayed and options on the sort field and order. Editing a filter gives the option to save it in the current view or as a new view.
