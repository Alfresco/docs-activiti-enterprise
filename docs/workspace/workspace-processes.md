# Workspace process instances
The processes section displays information about all process instances in an application. The default views are for currently running process instances under **Running Processes** and all completed process instances under **Completed Processes**. There is a further view that shows  process instances of all status types called **All Processes**. 

The possible statuses of a process instance are as follows:

| Status | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| RUNNING | The process instance is currently running |
| SUSPENDED | The process instance is currently suspended and cannot continue until it is reactivated |
| COMPLETED | The process instance is complete |
| CANCELLED | The process instance has been cancelled and cannot be completed |

## Starting a process instance
Use the following steps to start a new process instance:

1. Click **Create** and select **New Process**.
2. Enter a name for the process instance and select the process definition to use from the dropdown list.
3. Click **Start** to start the process instance. 

## Filtering process instances





There is a set of preset filters applied to process and task lists that can be customized or saved into new lists. 

Each view has a customizable filter associated with it, that can be used to change the process status on display and change the sort field and order. Editing a filter gives the option to save it in the current view or as a new view. 

Selecting a specific process instance opens up an information panel which displays basic properties about the process instance.
