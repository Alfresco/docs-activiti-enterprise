# Workspace processes
The processes section displays information about all process instances within the selected application. The default views are for currently running process instances under Running Processes and all completed process instances under Completed Processes. There is a further view that shows both completed and running process instances called All Processes. 

Each view has a customizable filter associated with it, that can be used to change the process status on display and change the sort field and order. Editing a filter gives the option to save it in the current view or as a new view. 

Selecting a specific process instance opens up an information panel which displays basic properties about the process instance. 

The possible statuses of a process instance are as follows:

| Status | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| RUNNING | The process instance is currently running |
| SUSPENDED | The process instance is currently suspended and cannot continue until it is reactivated |
| COMPLETED | The process instance is complete |
| CANCELLED | The process instance has been cancelled and cannot be completed |



There is a set of preset filters applied to process and task lists that can be customized or saved into new lists.
