# Alfresco Process Workspace

The Alfresco Process Workspace is used to view and manage [tasks](../workspace/workspace-tasks.md) and [process instances](../workspace/workspace-processes.md).

There is a set of preset filters applied to process and task lists that can be customized or saved into new lists. 

The Process Workspace is deployed into the namespace of each application so there will only be a single instance of it running. The URL to access it will be in the format: `{my-domain}/{application-name}/alfresco-process-app`. 


## About
The about page can be accessed via the UI or at the URL: `{my-domain}/alfresco-process-app/about` and shows the packages and package versions used in the application. 

## Settings
You can view the application configuration of the Process Workspace by visiting the URL:`{my-domain}/alfresco-modeling-app/app.config.json`.
