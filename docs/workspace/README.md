# Alfresco Process Workspace

The Alfresco Process Workspace is used to view and manage in progress [tasks](../workspace/workspace-tasks.md) and [process instances](../workspace/workspace-processes.md). It can also be used to start new tasks and process instances.

The Process Workspace is deployed into the namespace of each application so there will be multiple instances of it running. The URL to access it will be in the format: `{my-domain}/{application-name}/alfresco-process-app`. 

## About
The about page can be accessed via the UI or at the URL: `{my-domain}/{application-name}/alfresco-process-app/about` and shows the packages and package versions used in the application. 

## Settings
You can view the application configuration of the Process Workspace by visiting the URL:`{my-domain}/{application-name}/alfresco-process-app/app.config.json`.
