# Alfresco Process Workspace
The Alfresco Process Workspace is accessed by end-users to provide them a view of in progress [process instances](../workspace/workspace-processes.md) and [tasks](../workspace/workspace-tasks.md). Users are able to create new process instances and tasks and assign [forms](../modeling/modeling-forms/README.md) to standalone tasks. Users are also able to claim tasks that require human input and view and manage their workload in a dashboard.

An instance of the Process Workspace is deployed with each application so there will be multiple instances of it running. The URL to access it will be in the format: `{my-domain}/{application-name}/alfresco-process-app`. 

## About
The about page can be accessed via the UI or at the URL: `{my-domain}/{application-name}/alfresco-process-app/about` and shows the packages and package versions used in the application. 

## Settings
You can view the application configuration of the Process Workspace by visiting the URL:`{my-domain}/{application-name}/alfresco-process-app/app.config.json`.
