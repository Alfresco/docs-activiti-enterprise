# Introduction
Alfresco Activiti Enterprise is used for modeling and publishing process applications based on Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN). 

## Business Process Management
Business Process Management (BPM) is a method of modelling, optimizing and automating business processes. It allows processes to be analyzed and iterated upon to improve their efficiency and effectiveness. 

The current standard for modeling business processes graphically is [BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) 2.0](http://www.bpmn.org/). BPMN allows relatively non-technical business users to follow and understand an end-to-end process diagram, whilst more detail can be added for technical audiences.

A BPM solution allows the modeling of business processes graphically for high-level representation, with the underlying XML containing the technical detail. 

Alfresco Activiti Enterprise is a lightweight, java-centric BPM solution providing a suite of tools to model and automate business processes on distributed infrastructures.

## Alfresco Activiti Enterprise
Alfresco Activiti Enterprise has been re-designed from previous releases into a cloud native platform, in order to take advantage of the benefits of a cloud native approach to development. Alfresco Activiti Enterprise leverages the benefits of microservices and containerization to allow for quick, zero downtime deployments that are scalable.
