# User Interfaces
User interfaces for Alfresco Activiti Enterprise have been created using the [Application Development Framework (ADF)](https://www.alfresco.com/platform/alfresco-application-development-framework-adf). The interfaces are used for designing, deploying and monitoring applications, tasks and processes. 

The interfaces are as follows:

* The [Alfresco Modeling Application](../modeling/README.md) is used for creating projects that contain process definitions, forms and connectors.
* The [Alfresco Admin Application](../administrator/README.md) is used to deploy projects and monitor application status. 
* The [Alfresco Process Workspace](../workspace/README.md) is accessed by users so they can monitor, claim and action tasks and processes.
