# Identity Service
The [Identity Service](https://docs.alfresco.com/identity/concepts/identity-overview.html) is used by Activiti Enterprise for authorization and to manage user and role management.

You can log into the administration console for the Alfresco Identity Service by navigating to `identity.{domain-name}/auth` and using the username **admin** and password of **admin**.

**Note**: it is strongly recommended that you update the password for the administration console when you first log into it. 

A default realm of **alfresco** is already setup with the installation of Alfresco Activiti Enterprise.
