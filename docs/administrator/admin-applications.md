Title: Monitoring applications

# Monitoring applications
The **application instances** section is for monitoring the status of deployed applications. Users require the *APS_DEVOPS* role to view application instances.

As soon as an application has been deployed, it can be monitored in application instances. The possible statuses are mirrored visually and are as follows:

| Status | Description | 
| ------ | ----------- | 
|
|
|
|

Applications that have been successfully deployed can be removed using the **Undeploy** action. 

Applications in the process of being deployed or that have errored during deployment can be removed using the **Force Undeploy** action. 

An application that has been successfully deployed will use the application name for [API queries]().
