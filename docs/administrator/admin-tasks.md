Title: Monitoring tasks

# Monitoring tasks
The **tasks** section is for monitoring tasks of every status on an application-by-application basis and search for tasks by a specific name or status. Users require the *APS_ADMIN* role to view tasks. 

Using the filter option allows you to select to view tasks from a specific application, by name and/or status.

The possible statuses for tasks are:
	
| Status | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| CREATED | The task has not yet been assigned |
| ASSIGNED | The task is assigned but has not been completed |
| SUSPENDED | The task has been suspended and needs to be reactivated to continue |
| CANCELLED | The task has been cancelled and cannot be completed |
| COMPLETED | The task has been completed |

Selecting a specific task opens up an information panel which displays basic properties about a task. The **Due Date**, **Assignee**, **Priority** and **Description** of a task can be updated using this panel. 

Ticking the checkbox at top of the panel allows you to select multiple tasks and perform a bulk **Delete**, **Suspend** or **Activate** action against your selection.
