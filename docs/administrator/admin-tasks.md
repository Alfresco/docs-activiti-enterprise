# Tasks
Tasks allow you to monitor tasks of every status on an application-by-application basis and search for tasks by name or specific status. Users require the APS_ADMIN role to view tasks. 

Using the filter option allows you to select to view tasks from a specific application, name and status.

The possible statuses for tasks are:
	
| Status | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| CREATED | Task has not yet been assigned |
| ASSIGNED | Task is assigned but has not been completed |
| SUSPENDED | Task has been suspended and needs to be reactivated to continue |
| CANCELLED | Task has been cancelled and cannot be completed |
| COMPLETED | Task has been completed |

Selecting a specific task opens up an information panel which displays basic properties about a task. The Due Date, Assignee, Priority and Description of a task can be updated using this panel. 

Ticking the checkbox at top of the panel allows you to select multiple tasks and perform a bulk Delete, Suspend or Activate action against your selection.
